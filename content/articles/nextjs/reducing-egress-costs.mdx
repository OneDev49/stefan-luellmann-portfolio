title: "The Next.js Playbook: Mastering Egress & Reducing Cloud Costs"

---

Egress is a fundamental concept in web infrastructure, yet it is often the most overlooked by developers.
We tend to obsess over the execution speed of our code, but we neglect the **cost** of delivering it.

If you are hosting a media-heavy Next.js application on platforms like Vercel or Netlify without a proper storage strategy, you are sitting on a ticking time bomb.

Without understanding Egress, you cannot effectively architect a scalable application.

This article explores what Egress actually is, why the <Highlight color="code">/public</Highlight> folder is a production trap, and how to optimize your media pipeline to save resources and money.



<TextBlock>
## What is Egress?
Simply put, **Egress** is outbound traffic.
Every time a user visits your website, your server sends data (HTML, CSS, JS, Images) to their browser.
That data travel is Egress.

Cloud providers like Vercel and Netlify cover the costs for a certain amount of Egress.
If one unoptimized image is 1.5MB, you consume 1.5MB of your bandwidth quota every single time that image loads.

This sounds negligible for one user.
But if you have 10,000 visitors, that single image consumes **15GB** of bandwidth.
When you scale, this cost skyrockets.

## The /public Folder Trap
One of the most common architectural mistakes I encounter in Next.js projects is treating the <Highlight color="code">/public</Highlight> folder as a database for media.

The <Highlight color="code">/public</Highlight> folder is special. Files inside it are bundled with your deployment and served directly from the Edge. While this is fine for a 5KB favicon, it is a disaster for large assets.

Storing heavy media here creates three major problems:
1. **Git Bloat:** Storing binary files in Git slows down cloning and version control operations for the entire team.
2. **Slow CI/CD:** Your build server has to download and cache these assets every single time you deploy.
3. **Expensive Egress:** You are using premium "Application Bandwidth" to serve static assets.


TIP:
**Senior Architect Recommendation:**
Treat your Git repository as "Code Only".
If a file is not source code (like a PDFs, MP4s, or high resolution PNGs), it does not belong in your Git history.
**Rule of Thumb:** If the file is >5KB, it breaks the repository. Move it to Object Storage immediately.

## The Optimization Pipeline
Before we even discuss where to store files, we must discuss **Optimization**.
The most effective way to reduce Egress is to simply send less data.

Here is the specific workflow I use to ensure assets are production-ready.

<TextSpacer />
### Image Optimization
Sending a raw 5MB PNG is architectural negligence.

- **Format Shifting:** Shift from <Highlight color="code">.png</Highlight> or <Highlight color="code">.jpg</Highlight> to modern formats like <Highlight color="code">.webp</Highlight> or <Highlight color="code">.avif</Highlight>. These offer superior compression with no visible loss in quality.
- **Pre-Processing:** I personally use **GIMP** to scale images down to their display size. There is no reason to host a 4000x6000px image if it is rendered at 800x1200px.
- **Compression:** Tools like Compress-or-die.com are essential. My workflow is simple: Scale in GIMP > Drag into Compress-or-die > Export as WebP.

<TextSpacer />
### Video Optimization
Video is the heaviest asset type.
Never serve raw video files.
I use **FFmpeg**, the industry standard for video processing (used by Netflix and YouTube).
It allows you to compress and encode videos specifically for web streaming.

TIP:
**Tool Recommendation: FFmpeg
Using a CLI tool can be intimidating, but it offers the best compression.
Use this command to convert a video to a web optimized format:

<Highlight color="code">ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 output.mp4</Highlight>

This <Highlight color="code">crf 28</Highlight> flag tells FFmpeg to compress aggressively while maintaining visual quality, often reducing file size by 70%.

<TextBlock>
## The Architecture Shift: Separation of Concerns
Once the assets are optimized, we need to store them. To optimize costs, we need to decouple our **Code** from our **Assets**.
1. **Code (Vercel/Netlify):** Handles logic, SSR and API routes.
2. **Assets (Object Storage):** Handles images, videos and PDFs.

Services like **AWS S3** or **UploadThing** are designed specifically for this.
They offer massive storage at a fraction of the cost of Vercel's bandwidth.

### Implementing the "Asset Helper" Pattern
Hardcoding URLs (e.g.: <Highlight color="code">https://stefan-luellmann.com/image.png</Highlight>) is brittle and makes maintenance difficult.

Instead, I recommend using **Environment Variables** combined with a helper config file.
This keeps your code clean and allows you to switch storage providers without rewriting every component.

First we need to configure the Environment:
<CodeBlock language="env" filename=".env.local">
{`
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_URL="https://ufts.io/f/"
`}
</CodeBlock>

IMPORTANT:
**Remember to allow the URL in next.config.mjs**
When using a service such as UploadThing together with Next.js, remember that you have to allow the URL inside the <Highlight color="code">next.config.mjs</Highlight> file.

Next, create a centralized config file:
<CodeBlock language="typescript" filename="config/url.ts">
{`
export const UPLOADTHING_IMAGE_URL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_URL;
`}
</CodeBlock>

You can now use that constant inside all of your other files.
Your components are now agnostic to where the files live.
<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`
import { UPLOADTHING_IMAGE_URL } = "@/config/url";
import Image from "next/image";

export function HeroSection() {
  return (
    <div className="relative h-96 w-full">
      <Image
        src={\`\${UPLOADTHING_IMAGE_URL}/hero.jpg\`}}
        alt="Hero Banner"
        fill
        className="object-cover"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
`}
</CodeBlock>
</TextBlock>

## Closing Remarks
Optimizing resource usage is no longer a secondary task.
It is a mandatory skill for scalable development.

By optimizing your media workflow (using tools like GIMP and FFmpeg) and moving heavy assets into a dedicated Object Storage, you achieve three things:
1. **Minimal Egress** (Lower Costs).
2. **Faster CI/CD** (Smaller Git repo).
3. **Better User Experience** (Faster load times).

Happy Coding!
