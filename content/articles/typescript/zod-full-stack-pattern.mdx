When it comes to the development of production apps, type-safety is universally known to be extremely important.
Not having it results in bugs, frustration, and generally more problems down the line.
</Section>

<Section>
## What TypeScript can (and can't) do
TypeScript is one of the most used tools in Web Development.
It is used by developers all around the world to ensure that data types are consistent and safe, regardless of where they are used.

<CodeBlock language="TypeScript">
{`
interface User {
    id: string;
    email: string;
}
`}
</CodeBlock>

However, TypeScript itself can only ensure safety while you are **developing** the application.
Inside our code editor (e.g. VS Code), TypeScript ensures we adhere to the types we define.
But once the application goes online, TypeScript doesn't exist anymore.
This makes sense, because TypeScript is a __compile-time__ tool.
Once the application builds, it is translated into JavaScript.
And standard JavaScript doesn't have type-safety.
It only knows about the data values it has at that exact moment, and it doesn't care whether they are "safe" or not.

<CodeBlock language="TypeScript">
{`
// In JavaScript, this is valid (but dangerous):
let userData = "John";
userData = 123;
`}
</CodeBlock>

Only using TypeScript in pure Front-End applications is rarely an issue.
We, as developers, control the code, so we know the types are generally safe.
The same can't be said about **Full-Stack applications**.
Every Full-Stack App has a Back-End, and every Back-End deals with data that changes.
How can we ensure that both the Back-End and Front-End are type-safe and, most importantly, that we handle potential errors when data types don't align?

Take this code for example:

<CodeBlock language="TypeScript">
{`
// We expect a String
interface User {
    id: string;
}

// But the API might return a Number (or null)
const data = await fetch('/api/user');
// Result: The app crashes at runtime. 💥
`}
</CodeBlock>

We can declare a TypeScript interface, but whatever the API returns is essentially <Code>any</Code>.
There is no fixed data type guaranteed at runtime.
Even worse, if we develop the application to expect a <Code>string</Code> from the Back-End, but that data type changes to a <Code>number</Code> over the course of months, our application might crash.
Practices like this result in poor UX and difficult bugs to trace.

So the question is, how do we fix this?
The answer is simple: **We use Zod.**

## How to make Full-Stack applications fully Type-safe
Zod is a TypeScript schema validation library with advanced type inference.
What exactly does this mean?
It means it allows us to solve the issue for the Front-End needing TypeScript while the Back-End responds with unknown data.
Zod acts as a bridge, checking the data while the app is running.

Let's look at an example.
This is what our previous TypeScript interface looks like when written in Zod.

<CodeBlock language="TypeScript">
{`
import { z } from "zod";

// 1. Define the Schema (Runtime)
export const UserSchema = z.object({
    id: z.string().uuid(),
    email: z.string().email(),
});

// 2. Infer the Type (Compile Time)
export type User = z.infer<typeof UserSchema>;
`}
</CodeBlock>
The Zod code we just wrote does the same thing as the TypeScript interface.
However, the last line is the most important part.
By using <Code>infer</Code>, Zod transforms the schema into a TypeScript interface so that we can use it across the whole application.
It essentially works like a standard interface, but we can do a lot more with it - specifically, validation.

<Section>
## Full-Stack Error Handling using Zod
By itself, writing the schema doesn't make our application safe.
We have to use it to validate the input of the user or the response of the API.

Here is a practical example of a Server Action using Zod validation:

<CodeBlock language="TypeScript">
{`
import { UserSchema } from "@/lib/schemas";
import { db } from "@/lib/db";

// The input 'data' is unknown
export async function createUser(data: unknown) {

    // Validate strictly
    const result = UserSchema.safeParse(data);

    if(!result.success) {
      // Handle the error gracefully
      return { error: "Invalid Data Structure" };
    }

    // If we get here, TypeScript knows 'result.data' is safe
    await db.user.create({
        data: result.data
    });

}
`}
</CodeBlock>
In this code, we create a simple <Code>createUser</Code> function.
Take note that the data we provide to the function is type <Code>unknown</Code>.
If we didn't use Zod, we would be sending potentially dangerous data to our Database.
To validate the data, we have two methods: <Code>.parse()</Code> and <Code>.safeParse()</Code>.

The important difference is how errors are handled.
While <Code>.parse()</Code> results in a crash if the data is wrong, <Code>.safeParse()</Code> allows us to handle the error gracefully.

And that is what we are doing here.
We use <Code>.safeParse()</Code> to check the data first.
If the validation was a success (which we check using <Code>.success</Code>), we create the user.
If not, we return a custom error message.

And that is it.
Our application is now type-safe.
We can now use the Zod schema like a TypeScript interface, but with the added security of runtime validation.

## Closing remarks
One thing I need to make clear, however, is that we shouldn't use Zod everywhere.
I personally only use Zod for complex data validation and at system boundaries (APIs, Forms, Database calls).
I do not use Zod for every internal component I develop.

It is important to know when to use the tools we possess.
Knowing **when** to use them is what makes us engineers.

And now you know how to make your next Full-Stack application type-safe on both the Back-End and the Front-End at the same time.

Thank you for reading.
Happy coding!
