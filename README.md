# [EN] NordWebTec - Webstudio of Stefan Lüllmann
This is the code of [NordWebTec](https://www.nordwebtec.com/), the Webstudio of Stefan Lüllmann.
The complete Website was coded in Next.js together with Headless WordPress and deployed in Vercel.

## Content of the Website
My personal portfolio Website and Webstudio Website NordWebTec has a lot of different areas that you can explore!
All the parts of my Website are interesting, but for a easier navigation I have compiled this list of subpages:

(Please keep in mind that my Website is available in both English and German. The language switcher can be found at the very top of the page inside the navigation bar (and on mobile inside the mobile navbar) or at the very bottom inside the footer)

- [The English Homepage](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/) - The English Version of my personal Webstudio
- [About me Page](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/about-me/) - My About-Me page that has all the information about me and even additional links you might find useful!
- [Project Page](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/projects/) - My Project page. It harbours all the projects I have ever worked on, that I am still working on and the projects I plan to work on in the future. Take a look, I am sure there is something interesting in it for everyone!
- [My personal Blog](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/blog/) - Here I write articles, sometimes news and always new updates on projects I have been working on. You will find a blog article on every project I have ever created (even for this one - check it out here: [The new NordWebTec](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/blog/the-new-and-improved-nordwebtec/)).
- [My Contact Page](https://www.nordwebtec.com/en/contact/) - If you want to reach out to me, message me or ask any question (or maybe even collaborate on any sort of project) you can easily message me here.


There are obviously a lot more pages on my Webstudio Page - NordWebTec - but I leave the rest up for you to discover.


## Technologies used
This project uses: `WordPress (Headless)`, `Next.js`, `React`, `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Typescript`, `SCSS`

For my personal Webstudio I decided to use a Headless WordPress approach combined with Next.js.
Since WordPress is powering above 40% of the internet and since Next.js is really amazing to work with I decided to use the best of both worlds and create my personal website using Headless WordPress with Next.js and Vercel.
